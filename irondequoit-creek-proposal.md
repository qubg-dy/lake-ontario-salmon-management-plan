# Irondequoit Creek Habitat Restoration Proposal

## Introduction
Irondequoit Creek is a historically significant spawning tributary for Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario. The restoration of this creek is essential for re-establishing a self-sustaining salmon population. This proposal outlines key actions to restore fish passage and improve in-stream habitat.

## Barrier Mitigation
Major historical barriers include two low-head dams (Site A and Site B) and several undersized culverts that impede fish migration. Proposed actions:
- Complete removal of the two low-head dams, following engineering feasibility studies and sediment analysis.
- Retrofit five culverts with open-bottom arch designs to allow natural stream flow and fish passage.
- Install rock ramps or fish ladders where complete removal is not feasible.

## In-Stream Habitat
To create suitable spawning and rearing habitat, the following improvements are recommended:
- Addition of 500 cubic yards of clean, sized gravel (16–64 mm) to create spawning redds in targeted reaches.
- Placement of large woody debris (LWD) complexes to increase cover, reduce erosion, and create velocity refuges.
- Re-establishment of riparian vegetation along 2 miles of streambank to stabilize banks and provide shade.

## Monitoring Plan
A three-year monitoring program will assess project success:
- Annual electrofishing surveys (spring and fall) to quantify juvenile salmon abundance and species composition.
- Annual redd counts during spawning season (October–November) to document spawning activity.
- Continuous water quality monitoring (temperature, dissolved oxygen) at three stations.
- Pre- and post-construction habitat surveys using cross-sectional transects and pebble counts.

This proposal provides a foundation for collaborative implementation with local stakeholders and regulatory agencies.
